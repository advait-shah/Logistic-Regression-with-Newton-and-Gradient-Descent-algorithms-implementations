# Logistic-Regression-with-Newton-and-Gradient-Descent-algorithms-implementations
Machine Learning-Logistic regression-Python-MNIST Digits Dataset

- Achieved 87.3 % accuracy in handwritten digits prediction
- Used MNIST Dataset and trained model with logistic regression algorithm
- Implemented and compared Newton's and Gradient Descent algorithms in training weights of Logistic regression through regularized loss minimization
- Compared Space and time complexity of both algorithms
