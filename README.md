# Logistic-Regression-with-Newton-and-Gradient-Descent-algorithms-implementations
Machine Learning-Logistic regression-Python-MNIST Digits Dataset

- Achieved 87.3 % accuracy in correctly classifying the handwritten 5 and 6 digits
- used Python - Numpy, Matplotlib packages
- Used MNIST Dataset and trained model with logistic regression algorithm
- used cross-validation, log likelihood, hyper parameter tuning (identified best lambda when finding optimal weights of features in logistic regression)
- Implemented and compared Newton's and Gradient Descent algorithms in training weights of Logistic regression through regularized loss minimization, and Compared Space and time complexity of both of these algorithms
- Compared KNN and Logistic regression model based on accuracies and commented on linear separability of the dataset and expressivity of these two algorithms
